Our mission is to build the backbone for modern businesses through autonomy, automation, and the power of great data. By empowering our users to deeply understand their customers, they can offer truly personalized marketing and sales interactions. \n",
      "Lives Their Mission \n",
      "Here at Clearbit, our mission is to be the growth engine that helps push the edge of what‚Äôs possible in marketing and sales. We build data-driven products that enable businesses to generate demand, act on intent, drive conversions, and retain and expand their customers.Our marketing team is constantly curious, resourceful, and quick to learn. We take pride in nerding out about marketing technology.¬†Our strategies are built on the premise of utilizing data to make well-informed decisions. We‚Äôre constantly experimenting with new channels to uncover growth opportunities that drive tangible conversion outcomes for the company.As a team, we‚Äôve collectively aligned 5 core values that shape our internal culture:Care ‚Äì Give a shit: Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.Craft ‚Äì Master it: Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.Team ‚Äì Work together: Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚ÄùTruth ‚Äì Say it: Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.Initiative ‚Äì Be resourceful: Don‚Äôt wait for permission. Figure it out ‚Äî or figure out who can.Fun ‚Äì Have it: Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously ‚Äî life is short.Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one core value and a team member whose actions best exemplify this. This regular tradition provides new team members with the chance to experience first-hand how our core values influence our work. It also creates an opportunity to give recognition and appreciation to those who have worked hard. \n",
      "Supports Professional Development \n",
      "Our belief in meaningful growth extends to our employees. We invest in personal and team growth ‚Äì valuing constructive feedback and emotional intelligence. We maintain a working environment of psychological safety, where vulnerability is not a weakness. This creates a workspace where it‚Äôs easier to take creative risks, re-define what‚Äôs possible, and grow into the best version of yourself.¬†We‚Äôve built an environment where team members have the freedom and autonomy to experiment with new strategies and jump on opportunities as they arise.We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process. We celebrate when someone is learning, and also take time to reflect on when things don‚Äôt succeed (which is bound to happen from time to time).We work and learn fast, and have the infrastructure in place to facilitate our teams personal development. \n",
      "Work/Life Balance \n",
      "We work hard to create the best working environment for our team, supporting their needs on an individual level. Whether it be our dedicated health and wellness funds, or our generous insurance plans ‚Äì our teams physical and mental health is of the most importance to us.We remove the unnecessary stresses from working life, helping facilitate the best quality outputs. Our commuter benefits help those who travel into our office, and each day, our team of chefs cook both breakfast and lunch for the team.¬†We also promote flexible working hours and a flexible vacation policy, allowing team members to take time off to recharge and return to work with a clear mindset.Above all, our remote-friendly team allows us to work with the brightest individuals across the globe. As our team takes ownership of their work, we can confidently rely on the outputs of each individual. Our remote team members are still provided with equal opportunities for feedback and personal development. Each remote member has the opportunity to report directly to leaders of their relevant team to receive the level of feedback and support they need. \n",
      "Encourages Ownership Of Work \n",
      "Our team thrives when having the ability to self-direct. We‚Äôre collectively passionate about taking responsibility for the impact we create, and have a lot of freedom to do so throughout the process.Each team member is given a lot of autonomy and trust, which results in people genuinely caring about getting the job done (and doing it well). Our leadership has invested heavily in ‚Äúconscious leadership‚Äù, making feedback something that has a positive connotation.¬†We empower our team to individually keep track of moving parts and to remain nimble. This allows us to shift the proportions of outputs as they‚Äôre required. If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys handling responsibility and the benefits of delivering effective work, you‚Äôll thrive in our environment. \n",
      "Data-Driven \n",
      "We‚Äôre a team of highly analytical and data-driven individuals. We have a deep understanding of core marketing metrics and how they directly impact our business. We‚Äôre infatuated with testing new strategies, digging into data, then uncovering insights and improvements to apply across future campaigns. Each team member has a fluent understanding of the Clearbit product suite and how it can be used to enhance our day-to-day strategies with enriched data. \n",
      "Friends Outside Of Work \n",
      "Our teams passion for sharing with one another extends beyond our day-to-day roles. Clearbit is an inclusive environment where friendships form intuitively. Outside of work, you can catch our team kicking goals (literally) in the office kickball team, or making reservations to go out to lunch together. Once a year, we also take the time to bring our global team together for our offsite retreat. \n",

      "Defining Clearbit's company valuesClearbit customer loginBlog>Defining Clearbit's company valuesDefining Clearbit's company valuesMatt Sornson|August 12, 2019|4 minute readIn mid-2018, Clearbit was hitting an inflection point.\n",
      "Since our founding in 2014, we'd been running as a small, hyper-efficient, and profitable business. Just about everyone in the company would weigh in on new hires, and every new employee spent significant time with the entire leadership team to understand what our values were. This organic model started to show some cracks as we started to scale.\n",
      "At thirty-odd employees, Clearbit did already have a real set of values, even if not everyone could verbalize them. In line with how we were building the company ‚Äî deliberately and with a close eye on creating a culture we all wanted to be a part of ‚Äî it was time to get official. The challenge: to codify and articulate our internal operating principles.\n",
      "We've effectively tripled our team, while maintaining an incredibly high bar and preserving the culture we all cherish. Choosing and then using our values has been instrumental in that success.\n",
      "Surfacing values, from the bottom up\n",
      "We believe that values should be a reflection of the entire team, not just the CEO or leadership. So when we set out to formalize Clearbit's, we started by asking the team.\n",
      "We sent out a survey to every employee, asking them to submit up to three values that they thought best described our culture. Of equal importance, we asked that they nominate the person at Clearbit they thought best exemplified that value.\n",
      "We were expecting to see a wide array of suggestions and had anticipated that the responses would require some serious workshopping to produce a final set. Incredibly, from the over 70 value suggestions, ALL of them could be grouped into 7 themes.\n",
      "being customer centric / empathy for customers\n",
      "learning\n",
      "excellence / hard work\n",
      "self-sufficiency\n",
      "fun\n",
      "honest communication\n",
      "team\n",
      "We took this list and reworked them to sound as Clearbit-y as possible, which ended up being really easy as we had dozens of variations pre-written by everyone who had submitted ideas. We also combined two of the suggestions, as excellence and learning are inseparable in our minds.\n",
      "Clearbit's Values\n",
      "Care (Give a shit). Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.\n",
      "Craft (Master it). Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.\n",
      "Team (Work together). Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù\n",
      "Truth (Say it). Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.\n",
      "Initiative (Be resourceful). Don‚Äôt wait for permission. Figure it out ‚Äî or figure out who can.\n",
      "Fun (Have it). Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously ‚Äî life is short.\n",
      "So how do we actually use our values?\n",
      "Even the most thoughtfully-produced company values don't matter unless they're put into practice and used tactically. And when they're not actively referenced and applied across the company, they become an out-of-mind list that merely exists as a slide or rarely-opened document.\n",
      "Hiring rubric\n",
      "We built value testing into our hiring rubric and created semi-standardized questions that let us investigate without having to ask questions like, \"are you a team player?\".\n",
      "Person of the week\n",
      "Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one value and a person whose actions best exemplifies that value. This regular practice helps new people get acclimated and gives shape to a list of values they see in their onboarding docs. It also regularly reinforces the values across the company, providing repetition around what they are and a nice moment of recognition and appreciation for team members.\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process ‚Äî both by celebrating when someone really is leaning into a value and recognizing the learning moments when we fail to (which we all do sometimes).\n",
      "Values are alive!\n",
      "Our list of values is a living document that will evolve and change as we do. A company culture inevitably changes, and our values need to grow with us. If the values don't align or resonate with the individual values of our team, it's time to change.\n",
      "results of an internal survey measuring alignment between personal and company values\n",
      "Having integrity with our values is what builds trust in our relationships, and because we believe trust is the most basic building block of any organization, we commit to checking back on an annual basis to make sure we have values that truly represent our culture.\n",
      "It's easy to discount corporate values as just lip service and nice words to stick on the wall. However, when carefully created and implemented, values provide a constitution for your company culture, a true rubric that helps you hire, fire, promote, retain, and celebrate your team.\n",
